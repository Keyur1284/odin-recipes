    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grilled marinated chicken, topped with melted mozzarella, pesto, and cherry tomatoes makes a delicious summer meal! 
        Serve with rice or angel hair pasta.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup halved cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 fresh basil leaves, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup basil pesto</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gently pound chicken breasts into even thickness using the smooth side of a meat mallet, about 1/2 inch thick. 
            Place chicken into a resealable plastic bag.</li>
        <li>Whisk together olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, Italian seasoning, and salt in a small bowl. 
            Pour over chicken, coat evenly, and marinate for 4 to 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Combine cherry tomatoes, basil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat; lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and grill with the lid closed for 4 minutes. Flip chicken and grill an additional 3 to 4 minutes. 
            Top each breast with a slice of mozzarella cheese and 1 tablespoon of pesto, then top with cherry tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Close lid on grill and continue grilling until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink inside, about 3 more minutes. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Using a spatula, carefully remove chicken to a serving platter.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
    <p>If you are worried about tomatoes falling through the grill grates, 
        place chicken on a sheet of foil or in a disposable foil pan before adding toppings.</p>
